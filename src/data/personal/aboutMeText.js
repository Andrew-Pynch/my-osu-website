const aboutMeText = `In my past life, I was an engineer on the Yahoo Machine Learning and Vision team, where I got to research, design, and deploy some [very cool technologies](http://code.flickr.net/2014/10/20/introducing-flickr-park-or-bird/) at [massive scale](http://code.flickr.net/2014/05/20/computer-vision-at-scale-with-hadoop-and-storm/).  While I was at Yahoo, I also spent time working on Flickr's Front End team where I implemented and deployed [web](https://www.flickr.com/search) [pages](https://www.flickr.com/explore) that millions of people use every day.

Before Yahoo, I worked at a small computer vision startup named IQ Engines, which [Yahoo acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/23/yahoo-acquires-image-recognition-startup-iq-engines/), and long, long ago, I earned [my PhD](http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/30348) right here in the CS department of Oregon State.

Through it all, I've been and remain an avid brewer of beer, baker of bread, taker of photos, player of games, and lover of cats.`;
